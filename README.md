# Spinning Hexagon with a Bouncing Ball Inside It

I observed many content creators online experimenting with an interesting animation challenge: creating a spinning hexagon containing a bouncing ball that accurately collides with the rotating walls. This test has become a popular way to evaluate different AI models capabilities in generating precise animations and physics simulations.

So, i'll take this as a learning challenge for myself and try to recreate this manually.
